# TV Script Generation

In this project I generate 'fake' television scripts for once-popular TV show Seinfeld using RNN-LSTM.

I build RNN-LSTM custom model using Pytorch and tune hyperparameters on AWS.

After sucessfully training the model, I use model parameters to create 'fake' dialogues between the show's characters.
